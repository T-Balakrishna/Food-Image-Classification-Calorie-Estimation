# 🍔 Food Image Classification & Calorie Estimation

## 📘 Overview
This project combines **deep learning** with computer vision to classify food items and estimate their calorie content. It aims to assist users in managing dietary intake through image-based analysis.

## 🧠 Objective
To build an intelligent system that classifies food categories from images and provides approximate calorie values for each item.

## 📊 Dataset
Dataset used: [NutritionVerse Real Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nutritionverse/nutritionverse-real)

Includes image samples and corresponding calorie values for multiple food categories.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, PIL, NumPy, Pandas  
- **Model:** CNN-based deep learning architecture  
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook  

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and image augmentation  
2. CNN model design and compilation  
3. Model training and validation  
4. Calorie estimation using regression mapping  
5. Visualization of predictions and accuracy metrics  


## 📈 Results
- Accurate classification across multiple food categories  
- Calorie predictions close to expected nutritional values  

## 🧩 Future Improvements
- Add mobile integration for real-time food recognition  
- Expand dataset with localized cuisines for broader accuracy
